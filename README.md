ðŸ‘‹ My Story
--------------------------------------------------------
Hi I'm Rebecca O'Neill, a software developer based in London. 

After five years of working in innovation for consumer goods I decided to take a big step and explore the world of coding. I've recently completed a bootcamp with Le Wagon in London to jumpstart my career as a software developer, and am looking for my first role.

I'm a fast learner, eager to learn, well versed in agile ways of working and looking to use my problem solving skills from my previous life in this new world of tech.
